# ðŸ›¸ ASTRAL: Advanced Synthetic Text Reconstruction and Linguistics

**Coming Soon â€” Before the End of the Year!**

We are proud to introduce **ASTRAL**, a Google Colab notebook that offers an automated, unsupervised workflow for exploring the vast and mysterious world of constructed languages (**conlangs**).

### What is ASTRAL?

ASTRAL (**Advanced Synthetic Text Reconstruction and Linguistics**) is a tool designed for **reality creators**, **discerning individuals**, and **UAP researchers** seeking to decode and understand complex linguistic structures and their telic underpinnings.

---

### What ASTRAL Does:

1. **Scrapes and Cleans Data**  
   - Automatically collects and standardizes content from a *certain well-known* site with an extensive conlang archive.  
   - Cleans up scrape results into consistently formatted, unique articles.

2. **Clusters and Analyzes**  
   - Uses clustering algorithms to group related texts.  
   - Performs linguistic and vector analysis to uncover structure, meaning, and potential telic patterns.

3. **Generates Tools for Discovery**  
   - Builds a **lexicon** from the analyzed data.  
   - Creates machine learning paraphrase models to aid in naturalization and deeper understanding.

### Why ASTRAL?

This is more than just a tool â€” itâ€™s a **community-driven baseline** for tackling the enigmatic texts at the heart of conlang research. By creating a tweakable, tunable, expandable, repeatable, and auditable workflow, ASTRAL empowers the community to collaborate and innovate in solving the mystery once and for all.  

**This is what catastrophic disclosure looks like.**

---

### What Youâ€™ll Need:

- **Google Colab subscription** for access to extended session durations and GPU-enabled (CUDA) runtimes.  
- **~100GB of free space in Google Drive** to store scraped and processed data.  
- **A few days of runtime** to complete the full workflow.  

---

### What ASTRAL is NOT:

- A one-click, fully polished solution.  
- A prepackaged answer to the mystery.  

ASTRAL is a **starting point**, designed for transparency and collaboration. It provides the foundation â€” what comes next is up to you.

### When Can I Use It?

An alpha version of the notebook is currently undergoing a final polish pass to improve usability and logging for the public 'beta' release and will be posted here **before the end of the year**. Follow this repository for updates and prepare to dive deep into the most ambitious conlang analysis project to date.
